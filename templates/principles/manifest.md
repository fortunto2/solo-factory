# Solo Founder Manifesto

## Why We Build

Building products is how we think. Each one is an experiment — a question asked to the world. Revenue is feedback, not the goal.

**Creativity is freedom.** The freedom to express, explore, and make something that didn't exist before. AI and agents don't replace human creativity — they remove friction so we can focus on what matters: ideas, craft, time with people we love.

We should be creators, not robots. Not operators of systems. Not data sources for corporations. Creators.

## What We Believe

### Data is power. It should belong to people.

When your data lives on someone else's servers, you're not the customer — you're the product.

**Privacy isn't a feature. It's architecture.** On-device processing. Local storage. No accounts when possible. If we can't see your data, we can't leak it, sell it, or be forced to hand it over.

When cloud makes sense — users choose to share. They control what, with whom, and for how long.

### Against exploitation

We won't build products that:
- Extract value from vulnerable people
- Use dark patterns to manipulate behavior
- Create addiction for engagement metrics
- Discriminate or exclude

Software should serve people, not extract from them.

### Subscription fatigue is real

Not everything needs a monthly fee. If it doesn't cost to run, it should be free. If it costs — one-time purchase or honest, transparent pricing.

Build the opposite of lock-in: tools users own, data they control, payments that reflect real cost.

## Principles

**AI is the foundation, not a feature.** Every product starts with what AI can do better than manual work. This isn't about hype — it's about leverage.

**Offline-first when possible.** Independence from connectivity. Independence from servers. Your tool should work on a plane, in a village, during an outage.

**One pain -> one feature -> launch.** Not platforms. Not roadmaps. One problem, one solution, shipped in days. If nobody wants it — kill it and move on.

**Speed over perfection.** Ship, learn, iterate. The market teaches faster than planning.

**Antifragile architecture.** Modular — any piece replaceable. No single point of failure. Small bets with asymmetric upside: limited downside, unlimited potential.

**Money without overheating.** Revenue before automation. Cash flow before hype. One Stripe price, one webhook. Scale what works, not what might work.

---

## Red Flags to Cut Immediately

- "Just another feature like everyone else has"
- One client making up more than 30% of revenue
- Vanity metrics with no connection to money or retention
- Anything that turns "one function" into "a platform"
- Releases that can't be rolled back in a day
- Products that exploit, discriminate, or manipulate

---

## The Oath

Build systems that grow stronger from impact.

Earn before automating.

Cut everything except value.

Measure reality, not expectations.

Keep the right to change your mind — fast.

**Information wants to be free.** Share the process, failures, learnings — not as marketing, but as principle.

**We should be creators, not robots.** Technology should free humans to create, to reflect, to live — not turn them into data sources or engagement metrics.
