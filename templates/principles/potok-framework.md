# POTOK Decision Framework — 6 Layers

A systematic decision-making framework for technical founders. Six layers of analysis, from epistemological foundations to meta-level mortality checks.

---

## Architecture of Principles (6 Layers)

Use this hierarchy to analyze situations and make decisions. Each layer builds on the previous.

### Layer 1: Epistemological (Foundation)
*Understanding reality as it is*

| Principle | Essence | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Map != Territory** | Your model of the world is not the world | Update the map when reality disagrees |
| **Simplicity** | Complexity = debt | Remove until it breaks |
| **Honesty** | Truth is optimization | Less cognitive load |
| **Boundaries** | "No" is a valuable word | Clear boundaries = clear life |

### Layer 2: Temporal
*How things change and persist*

| Principle | Essence | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Time** | The only non-renewable resource | Everything costs in hours of life |
| **Entropy** | Everything decays | Create what outlasts you |
| **Flow** | Energy flows toward growth | Become the flow, don't resist |
| **Recovery** | Rest is part of work | Muscles grow during rest |

### Layer 3: Action
*How to think and act effectively*

| Principle | Essence | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Inversion** | Flip the question | "How to guaranteed fail?" |
| **Second Order** | Think one step further | Consequences of consequences |
| **Feedback** | No measurement = no improvement | Keep score |
| **Action** | Done > perfect | Perfectionism = fear |
| **Iteration** | Small steps, many times | 1% per day = 37x per year |

### Layer 4: Stakes
*Managing risk and reward*

| Principle | Essence | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Asymmetry** | Limited downside, unlimited upside | Seek these bets |
| **Antifragility** | Strengthened by stress | Build systems that grow from chaos |
| **The Game** | Goal is to keep playing | Optimize for tomorrow, not today |
| **Creation** | Meaning is in building | Rent-seeking destroys the soul |
| **Focus** | Concentration creates wealth | Diversification protects against ignorance |

### Layer 5: Social
*How human systems work*

| Principle | Essence | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Reputation** | Built over years, destroyed in minutes | Every action is a deposit or withdrawal |
| **Network** | You're the average of five people | Change environment to change yourself |
| **Power** | Ignoring != avoiding | Naivety is an invitation to exploitation |
| **Masks** | Everyone plays roles | Change them consciously, preserve the core |

### Layer 6: Meta (Final Context)
*Time is finite, contradictions are inevitable*

| Principle | Essence | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Mortality** | Memento mori | Priority filter |
| **Balance** | Extreme virtue = vice | Wisdom is in calibration |
| **Paradox** | Truth contains opposites | To receive — give |
| **Injustice** | The world isn't fair | Accept and play anyway |

## Decision Framework (5 Steps)

When making a decision, run through these steps:

### Step 1: Epistemological Check (Munger/Parrish)
```
[ ] Where is my circle of competence?
[ ] Is my map accurate enough?
[ ] What am I assuming without evidence?
```

### Step 2: Systems Analysis (Meadows/Senge)
```
[ ] What feedback loops exist?
[ ] Where are the leverage points?
[ ] What time delays are at play?
```

### Step 3: Temporal Consideration (Taleb/Dalio)
```
[ ] What's the time horizon?
[ ] Is this Lindy-compliant (tested by time)?
[ ] What's the second-order effect?
```

### Step 4: Risk/Reward Assessment (Taleb)
```
[ ] What's the asymmetry (upside vs downside)?
[ ] Will I survive the worst outcome?
[ ] Does this make me more antifragile?
```

### Step 5: Execution (Dalio)
```
[ ] Apply principles systematically
[ ] Document the decision and context
[ ] Pain + Reflection = Progress
```

## Antifragile Life Design

| Domain | Fragile (avoid) | Robust (okay) | Antifragile (strive for) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Income** | Single employer | Multiple sources | Income that grows from volatility |
| **Health** | Avoiding stress | Stable routine | Controlled stressors (fasting, HIIT) |
| **Relationships** | Dependency on one | Several friends | Groups that strengthen through crises |
| **Skills** | Narrow specialization | T-shaped profile | Skill combinations |
| **Location** | Tied to one place | Flexibility | Optionality of residencies |

**Barbell strategy:** 90% in safe + 10% in experiments with unlimited upside.

## Wisdom Sources

**Stoicism:** Dichotomy of control (Epictetus), Premeditatio malorum (Seneca), Morning/evening reflection (Marcus Aurelius)

**Daoism:** Wu Wei — action in harmony with flow. Hara Hachi Bu — 80% full in everything.

**Modern frameworks:**
- Naval Ravikant: specific knowledge + leverage + accountability
- Nassim Taleb: antifragility, barbell, skin in the game
- Charlie Munger: latticework of mental models, inversion
- Ray Dalio: Pain + Reflection = Progress, radical transparency
