# shellcheck config for solo-factory
# SC2004: $/${} unnecessary on arithmetic variables (style)
# SC2034: variable appears unused (false positives — vars used by sourced scripts)
# SC1091: not following sourced file (solo-lib.sh, same dir)
# SC2086: word splitting intentional ($CLAUDE_FLAGS, $MCP_FLAG need splitting into args)
# SC2207: array=($(cmd)) pattern is fine for our use (pane IDs are simple strings)
# SC2001: sed is fine, no need for ${var//} everywhere
# SC2011: ls -d pattern works for simple plan dir names
